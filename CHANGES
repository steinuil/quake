- Change "game" command to now exec quake.rc.

- Change "games" / "mods" commands to list all subdirectories.

- Restore vid_refreshrate from fitzquake-0.85 for SDL2 builds.

- Alpha-masked model support. (MF_HOLEY: 0x4000).

- Invalid skin index now draws skin 0 (WinQuake behaviour) instead of
  blue checkerboard.

- Change default screenshot format to png. The 'screenshot' command
  now supports optional format (tga, png or jpg) and quality (1-100)
  arguments.

- Revert "always run" changes from 0.85.9 and move the QuakeSpasm
  customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar: Set to 1 in order to
  scale forward/side/up speed by "cl_movespeedkey" (usually 2), and
  to make "speedkey" act as "slowkey".

- Change "always run" menu option to offer three choices:
  - off        (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)
  - vanilla    (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 400, cl_backspeed 400)
  - quakespasm (cl_alwaysrun 1, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200)

- New "r_scale" cvar. Set to 2, 3, or 4 to render the view at 1/2,
  1/3, or 1/4 resolution.

- Updated some of the third-party libraries.


Changes in 0.92.0
-----------------

- SDL2 Game Controller support.

- Contrast support with new "contrast" cvar, behaving the same as
  MarkV. It may be a useful alternative to the existing gamma control
  for laptops in a bright environment, etc. Raising contrast gives
  less of a gray/washed out look than raising gamma, but at a
  disadvantage: colors near white get clipped to white.

- RMQ protocol (999) support, adapted from RMQEngine.

- New "-protocol x" command line option. Accepted values for 'x' are
  15 (NetQuake), 666 (FitzQuake, default), and 999 (RMQ).

- New "setpos" console command.

- New "vid_borderless" cvar for getting a borderless window.

  on the hunk.

- gl_clear now defaults to 1.

- Fix items falling out of the world on oms3.bsp on SSE builds.

- Worked around an OSX 10.6 driver bug when using FSAA, which was
  leading to an unplayable HOM effect on the rest of the screen.

- Fix wrong trace endpoint from the tracepos console command.

- Updated some of the third-party libraries. Other fixes/clean-ups.

-----------------

### Bugfixes

- Fix unwanted fog mode change upon video restart.

- Work around Intel 855 bug in status bar drawing with "r_oldwater 0"
  and "scr_sbaralpha 0".

- Fix an obscure GLSL bug where changing gamma would result in the

  in 0.90.1).

- Prevent a possible buffer overflow in Cbuf_Execute (old Q1/Q2 bug).

- Prevent a possible vulnerability in MSG_ReadString (old Q1/Q2 bug).

### Visual improvements

- New cvars r_lavaalpha, r_slimealpha, r_telealpha for fine-tuning
  specific liquid opacities (from DirectQ/RMQEngine, non-archived,
  default to 0), and new worldspawn keys _wateralpha, _lavaalpha,
  _slimealpha, _telealpha, _skyfog (unique to Quakespasm, similar to
  the behaviour of the "fog" worldspawn key).

- GLSL gamma is now supported on older hardware without NPOT
  extension.

### Interface improvements

- New r_pos command to show player position.

- NaN detection in traceline with "developer 1" set now warns instead
  of errors.

  config.cfg.

- Default heapsize 256 MB (was 64 MB).

- Default zone 4 MB (was 384 KB).

- Raised MAX_SFX to 1024 (was 512).


Changes in 0.90.1
-----------------

### Bugfixes

- Fix dynamic light artifact where changing lightmap are rendered one
  frame late (bug introduced in 0.90.0).

- Allow loading saves with } character in quoted strings, fixes issue
  with retrojam1_skacky.bsp.

- Fix viewmodel not lerping on extended-limit maps.

- Fix crash on out-of-bounds skin number.

### Performance

- Use multithreaded OpenGL on OS X for better performance.

- New, faster mdl renderer using GLSL. Disable with "-noglslalias".

### Visual improvements

- New gamma correction implementation using GLSL. Fixes all known
  gamma issues (affecting the full display, persisting after
  quitting, or darkening the screen on OS X). Disable with
  "-noglslgamma".

- Use high-quality water by default (r_oldwater 0).

- Shadows use stencil buffer to avoid overlapping artifacts (from
  MarkV.)

- r_noshadow_list cvar added (from MarkV.)

### Interface improvements

- Support pausing demo playback with the "pause" command.

- Autocompletion for "game", "record", "playdemo".

- Experimental windowed fullscreen mode available with
  vid_desktopfullscreen 1 (only in SDL2 builds, takes effect upon
  entering fullscreen mode the next time.)

- Silence "exceeded standard limit" messages unless developer cvar is
  >= 1.

- Some spam moved from developer 1 to 2: "can't find tga/lit/ent",
  "trying to load ent", "bad chunk length", "meshing",
  "PR_AlocStringSlots: realloc'ing"

### Code cleanup

- Clean up IDE project files to build on fresh systems.

- Update 3rd-party libraries.


Changes in 0.90.0
-----------------

- Fix issues on Windows systems with DPI scaling.

- Unix/Mac user directories support. Disabled by default,
  'make DO_USERDIRS=1' to enable it.

- SDL2 support. Disabled by default, 'make USE_SDL2=1' to enable it.

- Revised keyboard input code.

- Revised/improved the 'game' command, i.e. on-the-fly mod changing.
  It now accepts an optional second argument for mission packs or
  quoth support i.e. -hipnotic, -rogue, or -quoth. For example, for
  WarpSpasm: "game warp -quoth"

- Command line: "-game {quoth/hipnotic/rogue}" is now treated the
  same as -quoth, -hipnotic, or -rogue.

- Console speed now resolution-independent.

- Disabled gl_zfix, which caused glitches and is undesirable for new
  maps. Replacement .ent files to fix z-fighting for several id1 maps
  added to quakespasm.pak.

- PF_VarString buffer bumped to 1024, avoids truncated centerprints
  from the 'In The Shadows' mod.

- Support for opengl non-power-of-two-textures extension (disable
  with command line: "-notexturenpot".)

- Support for OpenGL vertex buffer objects (VBO, OpenGL 1.5 or newer)
  for world and brush models (disable with command line: "-novbo".)

- Antialiasing (FSAA) support (command line: -fsaa x, where x can be
  0, 2, 4, 8).

- Fence textures support.

- Dynamic light speedup. Speedup loading of tga and pcx external
  images.

- Brush model drawing speedup.

- Support for BSP2 and 2PSB map formats.

- Support for Opus, FLAC, and tracker music (S3M, IT, UMX, etc.), as
  compile-time options.

- Music and sfx now mixed at 44100 Hz to avoid downsampling music.
  Low-pass filter applied to the sfx if -sndspeed is 11025 (the
  default), to preserve the same sound quality as 0.85.9.  New
  -mixspeed option sets the rate for mixing sfx and music, and output
  to the OS (default 44100), setting it to 11025 reverts to 0.85.9
  behaviour. New snd_filterquality cvar, value can be between 1
  (emulate OS X resampler) and 5 (emulate Windows resampler),
  controls the sound of the low-pass filter.

- Better Hor+ field of view (FOV) scaling behavior.

- Better cross-map demo playback support.

  using custom content.)

- Fix broken behavior upon gamedir changes if -basedir is specified
  on the command line.

- NET_MAXMESSAGE and MAX_MSGLEN limits bumped to 64000.

- MAX_EFRAGS bumped to 4096, and MAX_CHANNELS to 1024.

- MAX_ENT_LEAFS bumped from 16 to 32 to work around disappearing or
  flickering brush models in some situations. Also, if an entity is
  visible from MAX_ENT_LEAFS or more leafs, we now always send it to
  the client.

- Fix cvar cycle command not working sometimes.

- Host_Error upon missing models. (Prevents segmentation faults.)

- Change sv_aim default value to 1 (i.e. turn off autoaim)

- Add 'prev' and 'next' keywords to the 'cd' command.

- Work around a linux cdrom issue (playback might not start for a
  while after a stop).

- Quakespasm content customization moved from engine-embedded into a
  new optional quakespasm.pak file.

- Version bumped to 0.90.0 (because Quakespasm has a decent life of
  it's own)

- Other fixes and clean-ups.


Changes in 0.85.9
-----------------

- Fixes for several undefined behaviors in C code (gcc-4.8 support.)

- Implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for
  widescreen resolutions. Configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to
  1 and your fov will be scaled automatically according to the
  resolution. Enabled by default.

- Adjusted string buffers for PR_ValueString and friends to fix
  crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude
  mods.

- Toned down warning messages from PF_VarString() a bit.
