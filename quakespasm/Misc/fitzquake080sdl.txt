Minimum SDL version     : 1.2.10

This is a port of the Fitzquake engine to SDL. The main goal of this port is to
allow fitzquake to run on all major platforms. Currently there are builds for
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

To run this engine, you need to install the SDL and SDL_net library binaries. For
Linux, you should probably use the packages for your distribution which should be
available through your package manager of choice. The minimum SDL version you
need to run this is 1.2.10. On Windows, you can download the SDL and SDL_net dlls
from http://www.libsdl.org/. On Mac, the SDL framework is included in the
application bundle.

The Mac OS X version includes a simple launcher program.

Known issues:
- Mouse sensitivity is different than in the original Fitzquake (or vanilla Quake,
  for that matter).
- Pasting from the clipboard does not work.
- It is not possible to switch the screen refresh rates from within the engine.
- On Linux, there are problems with the default sound sampling rate of 11025Hz.
  This can be fixed by supplying -sndspeed 48000 on the commandline.

Changes since the March 7 beta:
- discard mouse movement while input is deactivated
- implement maps and mods commands using POSIX functions and added a POSIX wrapper
  for Win32
- activate mouse input when binding a key, otherwise mouse keys cannot be bound
  through the menu
- fixed shift key behaviour
- implemented TCP networking
- fixed fog command (use fmax instead of max in Fog_FogCommand_f)
- fixed bug that lead to the screen being set to minimum size when the sizedown
  command is issued multiple times
- LSHIFT + ESC and circomflex always opens the console
- print everything to stdout
- and more...
