</itemize>


<sect> Hints <p>

<em> Visit the <url url="http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake" name="FitzQuake Homepage"> for a full run-down of the engine's commands and variables.</em>

<itemize>
<item>To disable some changes, use "<bf>quakespasm -fitz</bf>"

<item>For different sound drivers use "<bf>SDL_AUDIODRIVER=</bf><em>DRIVER</em><bf> ./quakespasm</bf>"
, where DRIVER may be alsa, dsp, pulse, esd ...

<item><bf>Shift+Escape</bf> draws the Console.
<item>From the console, use <bf>UP</bf> to browse the command line history and
<bf>TAB</bf> to autocomplete command and map names.
<item>There is currently no CD Music volume support. cd_sdl.c needs replacing with cd_linux.c, cd_bsd.c etc..
<item>In windows, alternative CD drives are accessible by "<bf>quakespasm -cddev F</bf>" (for example)

<item>Quakespasm allows loading new games (mods) on the fly with "<bf>game</bf> <em>GAMENAME</em>"
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1>Music Playback<p>
Since version 0.85.4, Quakespasm can play back external MP3, OGG and Wave music files.
<itemize>
<item>Tracks should be named like "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg" ... (there is no track01) and placed into "Quake/id1/music".
<item>Unix users may need some extra libraries installed: "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG.
<item>To prevent tracks from being downsampled, use the "-sndspeed" option to set a sufficiently high sample rate.
<item>Use the "-noextmusic" option to disable this feature.
<item>See <url url="README.music"> for more details.
</itemize>


<sect> Compiling <p>
<p>To check-out the latest version of QuakeSpasm, use :
<newline>
<em>svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/quakespasm/code/trunk/quakespasm</em></p>

<sect1> Linux/Unix <p>
After extracting the source tarball, browse the Makefile and edit the music streaming options, then
<code>
make
cp quakespasm /usr/local/games/quake (for example)
</code>
<newline>
Compile time options include
<itemize>
<item><bf>make DEBUG=1</bf> for debugging
<item><bf>make SDL_CONFIG=</bf><em>/PATH/TO/SDL-CONFIG</em> for unusual SDL installations
</itemize>
<p>Streaming music playback requires "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG files.
<p>HOME directory support can be enabled via <bf>Misc/homedir_0.patch</bf>
<p>The project can also be built with Codeblocks (project files included).</p>

<sect1> Windows <p>
The QuakeSpasm developers cross-compile windows binaries using <url url="http://www.mingw.org" name="MinGW"> and <url url="http://mingw-w64.sf.net" name="Mingw-w64">.

The project can also be built using Visual Studio 2005 (or newer).</p>

<sect1> Mac OS X <p>
A Quakespasm App (including program launcher and update framework) can be made using the <bf>Xcode</bf> template found in the MacOSX directory.

Alternatively, have a look at <bf>Makefile.darwin</bf> for more instructions on building from a console.
</p>

<sect> Known Bugs <p>
Some versions of Xorg and SDL have brightness issues. If you have Xorg >= 7.5 and broken brightness,
these patched libSDL binaries may help.

<sect1> Changes in 0.85.9<p>
<itemize>
<item> Fixes for several undefined behaviors in C code (gcc-4.8 support.)
<item> Implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for widescreen resolutions. Configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to 1 and your fov will be scaled automatically according to the resolution. Enabled by default.
<item> Adjusted string buffers for PR_ValueString and friends to fix crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude mods.
<item> Toned down warning messages from PF_VarString() a bit.
<item> Fixed Fitzquake's map existence check in changelevel (used to leak file handles which would end up in a Sys_Error() due to consuming all free handles if many maps reside not in pak files.)
<item> Fixes/cleanups in chat mode handling. Client no longer gets stuck in chat mode upon disconnect.
<item> Mouse grab/key_dest fixes and key cleanups.
<item> The "speedkey" now acts as "slowkey" when "always run" is on.
